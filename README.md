# PRF-Android

## Environment for Compilation
In Android Studio, 
- Please set Gradle to version 7.3.3 (File->Project Structure)
- Please set Gradle JDK to version jbr-17 (File->Settings->Build,Execution,Deployment->Build Tools->Gradle)

Then build the project again.



Tutorial Samples
================
A set of samples to illustrate Vulkan API on Android with Android Studio		
To build on windows for tutorial02/03, copy/install ndk-r12 ( or better ) to a directory close to root dir ( C: ) to workaround command path 260 character limit issue; see tutorial02/03's build.gradle for details. To Build samples:
- Inside Andriod, menu File --> New --> Import Project
- Find your sample's build.gradle and open it
This will force andrioid studio to create local.properties file to config your SDK and NDK location; if you see error during importing, open local.properties file and correct the NDK and SDK location, then re-sync.
